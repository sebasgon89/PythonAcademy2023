# LAB TIME!

# 1
# Design a function that returns true if the month passed by parameter
# is the last month of the year, or returns how many months remain
# to end the year


# 2
# Design a function that takes a parameter, called month, and
# returns the number of days in that month.
# For example, parameter "january" return "31", parameter "april" return 30

# 3
# Design a function that takes 3 parameters.
# You need to check if they are integers.
# If they are not, it must return None.
# If they are all 3 integers, return the power between them.
