# 1
# use the class person from previous excercise.

# 2
# create a class called Student
# that will inherit properties and methods from a class named Person

# 3
# Create a function called "current" in the student class, which receives as a
# parameter the course to which the student is assigned.

# 4
# What happens if we want to show the course in an object that never
# executes the "current" function?

# 5
# fix the previous problem (hint: use the init! but on Student class ... )
